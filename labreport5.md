__Student:__ Hi! I have an error running the test.sh file, I think it has something to do with the JUnit testing since it won't tell me if I failed or passed the tests. But I didn't change the file that was originally given.

__TA:__ Hello Student! Are you sure that you are using the right commands based on your operating system?
<br>

__Student:__ Oh! I got it, didn't realize it was the macOS commands when I have Windows. So the bug was that I was using macOS commands to compile and run the code when I should've changed it to be Windows. ![image](https://github.com/divine9223/cse15l-lab-reports/assets/147002921/fabae46c-09e9-4112-aac7-0b447658c2ae)

Had to switch the ":" to ";" and then put quotes around `.;lib/junit-4.13.2.jar;lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar`

# Part 2:
Something that I learned was that I can read and edit files through the terminal. I don't even need the explorer tab in VS code when I can work and figure out the directories through the terminal. I also found it interesting about how the ssh in github was used, since I can use a remote server and use that ssh so that I don't have to worry about logging in. Overall, I learned a lot of skills that I wasn't familiar with before, some new and some that I was unsure of how to use. I also learned about people's pets! It created some fun interesting topics and helped us get to know each other better.
